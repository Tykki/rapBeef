              <h2>Act I: You Got The Juice Now!</h2>
              <p>Tupac Shakur, commonly known as 2Pac, was an influential American rapper, actor, and activist. He was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, New York City, and raised primarily in the Bronx. 2Pac rose to prominence in the early 1990s as one of the most prominent figures in West Coast hip-hop, particularly through his affiliation with Death Row Records, headed by Suge Knight. He released his debut album, "2Pacalypse Now," in 1991, which addressed social issues such as racism, violence, and poverty.</p>

              <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
              <p>Tupac felt betrayed by Biggie and others in the East Coast hip-hop scene. He believed that Biggie, along with other East Coast rappers, had a hand in orchestrating the 1994 shooting where Tupac was shot multiple times. Tupac interpreted this as a sign of disloyalty and a breach of trust.
              Tupac's response to what he perceived as betrayal was aggressive and personal. He released diss tracks like "Hit 'Em Up," where he directly attacked Biggie, accusing him of stealing his style, betraying their friendship, and even mocking Biggie's weight and relationship with Faith Evans. Tupac saw these attacks as a way to defend his honor and reputation.</p>

              <p>Christopher Wallace, known by his stage names The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls, was an iconic American rapper and songwriter. He was born on May 21, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York City. Biggie Smalls emerged as a central figure in the East Coast hip-hop scene during the 1990s. He rose to prominence with his debut album, "Ready to Die," released in 1994. The album showcased Biggie's distinctive flow, vivid storytelling, and lyrical prowess, earning critical acclaim and commercial success. Tracks like "Juicy," "Big Poppa," and "One More Chance" became instant classics and solidified his status as one of the greatest rappers of his generation.</p>

              <p>Biggie, on the other hand, may have viewed the conflict with Tupac as a series of misunderstandings that spiraled out of control. While there were tensions between them, Biggie may not have anticipated the level of animosity and violence that would result from their feud.
              Biggie's responses to Tupac's diss tracks were more subdued compared to Tupac's aggressive attacks. He attempted to downplay the conflict and even expressed regret over the deteriorating relationship between them. Biggie may have hoped for a reconciliation, as evidenced by his efforts to reach out to Tupac through intermediaries.</p>

Biggie's own life was tragically cut short just months later, further fueling the narrative of the East Coast-West Coast rivalry as a destructive force in hip-hop.</p>

              <p>Pusha T has long been known for his confrontational and gritty style, often delving into themes of street life and authenticity. From his perspective, the conflict with Drake began with perceived subliminal shots in Drake's music, particularly in tracks like "Two Birds, One Stone" where Drake appeared to take aim at Pusha T and his label boss, Kanye West. Pusha T saw these perceived jabs as disrespectful and decided to respond. He released the song "Infrared" as part of his album "Daytona," where he took direct shots at Drake, accusing him of not writing his own lyrics and questioning his authenticity as a rapper. This ignited the feud further, prompting Drake to respond with "Duppy Freestyle."

In his response track, "Duppy Freestyle," Drake fired back at Pusha T, criticizing his relevance in the rap game and dismissing his claims about Drake's authenticity. Drake also addressed Pusha T's past drug-dealing persona, implying that it was exaggerated. However, the feud escalated dramatically when Pusha T responded with "The Story of Adidon," a scathing diss track that revealed personal information about Drake, including details about his alleged secret child and his relationship with his parents. Pusha T's track was widely regarded as one of the most ruthless diss tracks in recent memory, and it put Drake on the defensive.</p>
