            <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
            <p>Pusha T has long been known for his confrontational and gritty style, often delving into themes of street life and authenticity. From his perspective, the conflict with Drake began with perceived subliminal shots in Drake's music, particularly in tracks like "Two Birds, One Stone" where Drake appeared to take aim at Pusha T and his label boss, Kanye West. Pusha T saw these perceived jabs as disrespectful and decided to respond. He released the song "Infrared" as part of his album "Daytona," where he took direct shots at Drake, accusing him of not writing his own lyrics and questioning his authenticity as a rapper. This ignited the feud further, prompting Drake to respond with "Duppy Freestyle."

            <h2>Act I: Started From The Bottom!</h2>
            <p>Drake, born Aubrey Drake Graham on October 24, 1986, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, and entrepreneur. He was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Drake initially gained recognition for his role as Jimmy Brooks on the teen drama television series "Degrassi: The Next Generation." However, he transitioned to music and released his debut mixtape, "Room for Improvement," in 2006, followed by "Comeback Season" in 2007. These mixtapes helped establish his reputation as a skilled rapper and lyricist.</p>

            <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
            <p>Drake, on the other hand, saw Pusha T's initial shots as unwarranted and felt the need to defend himself. In his response track, "Duppy Freestyle," Drake fired back at Pusha T, criticizing his relevance in the rap game and dismissing his claims about Drake's authenticity. Drake also addressed Pusha T's past drug-dealing persona, implying that it was exaggerated. However, the feud escalated dramatically when Pusha T responded with "The Story of Adidon," a scathing diss track that revealed personal information about Drake, including details about his alleged secret child and his relationship with his parents. Pusha T's track was widely regarded as one of the most ruthless diss tracks in recent memory, and it put Drake on the defensive.</p>
