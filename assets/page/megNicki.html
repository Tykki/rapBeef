            <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
            <p>Nicki and Megan’s first interaction was when Nicki joined Megan’s Instagram live.It appeared all was well and Nicki agreed to feature on Megan’s song ‘Hot Girl Summer’ for free.Reportedly, there was friction on the set where according to Nicki Megan tried to peer pressure her into drinking even though she was trying to get pregnant. Additionally, Megan was scheduled for Nicki’s Queen Radio show and never showed up. Then after Megan did a collaboration with known Nicki rival Cardi B on ‘Wap’ it was all downhill from there. For the next couple of years there were subliminals, thrown back and forth until Megan’s ‘Hiss’ was released.</p>

            <h2>Act III: The Outcome</h2>
            <p>After Megan released ‘Hiss’ Nicki ran to X the site formerly known as Twitter to respond. Over the course of four days, Nicki accused Megan of “lying on her dead mama”, advising her to get an abortion on the set of the ‘Hot Girl Summer’ video shoot, implied that Megan’s awards were undeserved, sleeping with her best friend’s man, and made fun of Megan’s incident with Tory Lanez. Nicki dropped ‘Bigfoot’ in response to ‘Hiss’ and at this point Megan has seemingly not responded.
