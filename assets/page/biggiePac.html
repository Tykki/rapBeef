            <h2>Act I: You Got The Juice Now!</h2>
            <p>Tupac Shakur, commonly known as 2Pac, was an influential American rapper, actor, and activist. He was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, New York City, and raised primarily in the Bronx. 2Pac rose to prominence in the early 1990s as one of the most prominent figures in West Coast hip-hop, particularly through his affiliation with Death Row Records, headed by Suge Knight. He released his debut album, "2Pacalypse Now," in 1991, which addressed social issues such as racism, violence, and poverty.</p>

            <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
            <p>Tupac felt betrayed by Biggie and others in the East Coast hip-hop scene. He believed that Biggie, along with other East Coast rappers, had a hand in orchestrating the 1994 shooting where Tupac was shot multiple times. Tupac interpreted this as a sign of disloyalty and a breach of trust.
            Tupac's response to what he perceived as betrayal was aggressive and personal. He released diss tracks like "Hit 'Em Up," where he directly attacked Biggie, accusing him of stealing his style, betraying their friendship, and even mocking Biggie's weight and relationship with Faith Evans. Tupac saw these attacks as a way to defend his honor and reputation.</p>

            <h2>Act II: The Beef</h2>
            <p>Biggie, on the other hand, may have viewed the conflict with Tupac as a series of misunderstandings that spiraled out of control. While there were tensions between them, Biggie may not have anticipated the level of animosity and violence that would result from their feud.
            Biggie's responses to Tupac's diss tracks were more subdued compared to Tupac's aggressive attacks. He attempted to downplay the conflict and even expressed regret over the deteriorating relationship between them. Biggie may have hoped for a reconciliation, as evidenced by his efforts to reach out to Tupac through intermediaries.</p>

            <h2>Act III: The Outcome</h2>
            <p>From Biggie's perspective, the feud with Tupac likely ended in tragedy. Biggie was devastated by Tupac's death and faced increased scrutiny and suspicion in the aftermath. Biggie's own life was tragically cut short just months later, further fueling the narrative of the East Coast-West Coast rivalry as a destructive force in hip-hop.</p>
